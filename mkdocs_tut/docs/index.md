# Welcome to Python Handbook

## Preface

Over the past 3 years of my Python experience, I came to realize that after the beginner stage of learning and somehow missing the flow make you revisit the learning sources to keep up.

But, Almost all learning sources are made with keeping in mind that the source can be browsed by a very beginner. So, you have to deal with the ground steps and a lot of unnecessary text to reach up to your current stage.

Enters **Python Handbook** into the picture. Here we have skipped all the extra reading text and present to you the only essential components with direct brief information/description and demo example. So, you can pace your understanding and come back any time to refresh a specific topic or just a single liner.
